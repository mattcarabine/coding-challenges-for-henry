# Matt's example coding challenges

Each subdirectory includes a unique coding challenge with a README, explaining what to do.

## Submission workflow

1. Use this template to create a repository for your challenge (click the green 'Use this template' button) 
2. Create your code in the relevant subdirectory for the challenge
3. When it's finished, commit and push this to the repo you created and let the person who set the challenge know, so that they can review
