# Todo List 
Write a program that can manage a todo list for you.

## Requirements

While the actual interface you want to use (e.g. CLI, browser-based, GUI application) is up to you, your solution must meet _all_ of the following requirements:

- Todo items must consist of (at least) a textual description
- Must have ability to add a new todo item
- Must have ability to delete a todo item, this means that it should no longer exist or show up in any output
- Must have ability to edit the description of a todo item
- Must have ability mark a todo item as complete
- Must have ability to view all incomplete items
- Must have ability to view all complete items
- Must have ability to view all items
- The todo list must persist through machine reboots

There are also a few stretch goals that it's worth considering if you want to improve your solution.
You must pick at least one of these to implement, though you will not be penalised if you do not select more than one:

- Have ability to manage multiple todo lists (e.g. shopping, work, DIY)
- Have ability to add a due date to todo items, showing all overdue or shortly upcoming items
- Have ability to add icons for each todo item, that can be set by the user
- Have ability to search through your todo items for specific terms (think Google search), this can be as advanced or simple as you'd like.

## Objectives 

The purpose of this challenge:

- Write clean, robust, well factored, well named, easy to understand code.
- Understand the requirements and produce a result that satisfies them, your solution will be measured directly against the requirements.
- Create an easy-to-use interface for the application, whether that's graphical or textual, ease-of-use will be scored highly.
- Anticipate ways in which the app could fail and test to make sure those situations are accounted for, including invalid input.

What won't be specifically judged:
- Performance optimization.
- Writing everything from scratch, if it is already offered in an existing standard library then you should use it.

## Documentation
There should be instructions on how to:

- Run the program, including installing any dependencies. 
- Achieve the requirements specified in the brief (e.g. "How do I add an item")

## Rules
- You may use any of the following programming languages: `Python`, `Java`, `Go`, `C/C++`, `C#`, `Node.js`.
- Feel free to use any built-in standard libraries for the programming language you intend to use.  You may also use a 3rd party library, but please justify its use and explain the reason for doing so.
- You may not ask specific questions on Stack Overflow or to anyone you know, you can ask clarifying questions to the person who set the challenge
